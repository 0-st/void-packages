SHELL HELPERS
=============

This directory contains shell files that are read by xbps-src and can be used at any
phase when building source packages. Only files with the `.sh' extension will be read.

A shell helper must provide its own function for use in the source packages.
The following examples illustrates a fake helper named `myhelper.sh' that provides
the `myhelper_func' function:

myhelper.sh:
...
myhelper_func() {
	...
}
...

You can then use this helper in a source package like this:

srcpkgs/foo/template:
...
do_install() {
	myhelper_func ...
}
...
