ENVIRONMENT SHELL SNIPPETS
==========================

This directory contains shell files (must not be executable nor contain a shebang)
that are read by xbps-src when building source packages. The shell files
are read in lexical order (as ordered by shell rules).

These files shall set environment variables for use in the xbps-src helpers
(libexec/xbps-src-*). Only files with the `.sh' extension are read, so this file
will be simply ignored.
