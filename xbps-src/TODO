- Split pkgs with "Add_dependency full" into build and run depends,
  adding -devel pkgs as builddeps. Almost all packages are converted,
  but probably a few remain. Probably not fully finished yet...

- Make src packages self contained, without requiring to download 
  the whole repository.

- Add documentation explaining stuff to create build templates.
  Explain extensively available variables, build phases, etc.

- Fix packages with the "XXX" mark.

- Make all packages use $homepage and $license. base-files installs
  common license files into /usr/share/licenses, if any package uses any
  other license not installed there, it should be installed into
  /usr/share/licenses/$pkgname. Also $license should match the file names
  available in /usr/share/licenses when using common licenses.
