This is the incomplete list of currently implemented features:

* Packages are built from sources in a chroot, thus avoiding dependency
  incompatibilities with installed system.

* Automatic compression of manual pages.

* Automatic compression of info files.

* Registers and unregisters info files automatically.

* Registers and unregisters shells in /etc/shells automatically.

* Binary package hash is checked before installing with SHA256 algorithm.

* Before removing a package, the hash of installed files is checked
  to found modified files and ignores them if they were modified.

* Configuration files are preserved if they are modified.

* Support for multiple binary local package repositories.

* Support for running a script at pre/post install/remove in binpkgs.

* Support for running triggers at pre/post install/remove in binpkgs.

* Finds and removes orphan packages, i.e packages that were installed
  automatically (required by some other package that was installed but
  any package currently depends on).

* Show properties of available packages in repositories, as well as
  installed. Like dependencies, installed size, binary package size,
  configuration files, description, etc.

* Listing of files for binary packages, plus a flag is used to check
  the SHA256 hash of any file in a package while listing them.
