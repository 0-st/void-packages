A binary package built with xbps is a normal tar(1) archive, compressed
with bzip2 and has the following structure:

	/
	/usr ------|
	/var ------| => Package structure that will be installed.
	/etc ------|
	...
	/var/cache/xbps/metadata/$pkgname
	/var/cache/xbps/metadata/$pkgname/flist
	/var/cache/xbps/metadata/$pkgname/props.plist
	/var/cache/xbps/metadata/$pkgname/prepost-inst
	/var/cache/xbps/metadata/$pkgname/prepost-rm

Metadata info is stored in the "/var/cache/xbps/metadata/$pkgname"
directory and two files will be always be present: flist and props.plist.

The flist file contains the list of files that the package will
install. The props.plist file is a proplib(3) property list and
has the following structure:

<dict>
	<key>pkgname</key>
	<string>foo</string>

	<key>version</key>
	<string>3.40</string>

	<key>maintainer</key>
	<string>The Master BOFH <bofh@baobab.org> </string>

	<key>short_desc</key>
	<string>Foo is a virtual package</string>

	<key>long_desc</key>
	<string>
 Foo is a virtual package to show how the metadata props.plist file works
 with xbps handling binary packages.</string>

	<key>architecture</key>
	<string>x86_64</string>

	<key>installed_size</key>
	<integer>500000</integer>

	<key>configuration_files</key>
	<array>
		<string>/etc/foo.conf</string>
		...
	</array>
	<key>run_depends</key>
	<array>
		<string>bofh-2.0</string>
		<string>blab-1.1</string>
		...
	</array>
	...
</dict>

The prepost-* executables allows you to trigger any action
at pre/post installation/removal of the binary package.

The package's dictionary will also be written into the repository's package
index file, that describes information about a binary package on it.
See the BINPKG_REPOSITORY file for more info about repositories.
