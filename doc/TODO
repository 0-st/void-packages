xbps-src:
 * Personalized scripts per template to unpack distfiles.
 * Multiple URLs to download source distribution files, aliases, etc.
   Something like ${sourceforge} to pick up any specified mirror on the list.
 * Fix -C flag while building packages via chroot.

Packages:
 * fix mpfr hardcoded rpath for gmp.
 * Create /etc/issue.
 * Add a trigger for fc-cache.
 * Add a trigger to (un)register users/groups. Currently packages that
   require user/groups use custom INSTALL/REMOVE scripts, which adds
   a lot of duplicated work.
 * How to handle kernel package upgrades? dpkg seems to keep previous
   package and its initramfs, and a dummy package depends on the latest one.
   I think this is the best option.
 * Fix initramfs-tools trigger for $pkgname != kernel.
 * Fix initramfs-tools 'update-initramfs -a'.
 * Avoid the need to use $sourcepkg and $subpackages in template files,
   these vars shouldn't be needed to be set manually; find a way!
 * Fix HAL/PolicyKit for nonroot to be able to admin tasks.

xbps-bin:
 * Add support to handle conf_files and keep_dirs from package metadata.
   [PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED]
 * Add support to install binary packages without any repository.
 * Add a target to update all currently installed packages, like
   "apt-get dist-upgrade". [IN PROGRESS]
 * Add a flag to reinstall a package version that is already installed,
   overwritting files on disk and updating required_by if required.
   Perhaps change the automatic-install object to false, like pkg_install
   from NetBSD do.
 * When checking file hash integrity (with -C files), it doesn't take
   into account configuration files.
 * Implement shell style match patterns with fnmatch().

xbps-repo:
 * Add support for remote repositories, requires libfetch.
