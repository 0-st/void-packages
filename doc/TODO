xbps-src:
 * Personalized scripts per template to unpack distfiles.
 * Multiple URLs to download source distribution files, aliases, etc.
   Something like ${sourceforge} to pick up any specified mirror on the list.
 * Add support to run the prepost-* scripts, so that the same actions are
   performed in source/bin packages. Use current postinstall_helpers to
   automatically add triggers, shared by src/bin pkgs.

Packages:
 * fix mpfr hardcoded rpath for gmp.

xbps-bin:
 * Add support to handle conf_files and keep_dirs from package metadata.
   [PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED]
 * Add support to detect orphaned packages, something like
   "apt-get autoremove" [IN PROGRESS]
 * Add support to install binary packages without any repository.
 * Check SHA256 hash of pkg and dependencies before installing.
   Currently the hash is checked before a pkg is unpacked, this is
   suboptimal because if some pkg fails, previous packages will be
   installed and therefore unusable. [IN PROGRESS]

xbps-repo:
 * Replace binpkg-genindex.sh with a target for xbps-repo to generate the
   index. The goal is to be able to add/remove a package without having to
   create the file from scratch, for performance.
