xbps.sh:
 * Personalized scripts per template to unpack distfiles.
 * Multiple URLs to download source distribution files, aliases, etc.
   Something like ${sourceforge} to pick up any specified mirror on the list.
 * More robust and fast dependency checking.
 * $version needs to have a dot to be found by xbps.sh.
   Some packages do not have a dot on its version, like udev-130.
 * xbps-cmpver fails in some cases: foo-2.0 vs foo-1.99 and foo-2a vs foo-2b.
 * Actually code the utility to handle binary packages (IN PROGRESS).

Packages:
 * fix mpfr hardcoded rpath for gmp.
 * Fix sudo permissions for /etc/sudoers. This must be 644 to be able to
   build the binary package.
