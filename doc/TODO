xbps-src:
 * Personalized scripts per template to unpack distfiles.
 * Multiple URLs to download source distribution files, aliases, etc.
   Something like ${sourceforge} to pick up any specified mirror on the list.
 * Add support to run the prepost-* scripts, so that the same actions are
   performed in source/bin packages. Use current postinstall_helpers to
   automatically add triggers, shared by src/bin pkgs. [IN PROGRESS]

Packages:
 * fix mpfr hardcoded rpath for gmp.

xbps-bin:
 * Add support to handle conf_files and keep_dirs from package metadata.
 * Add support to remove recursively all deps of a package. [IN PROGRESS]
 * Add support to detect orphaned packages.
 * Add support to check sha256 hashes of all installed files, as well as
   hashes for binary packages before installation happens.
 * Add support to install binary packages without any repository.

xbps-repo:
 * Replace binpkg-genindex.sh with a target for xbps-repo to generate the
   index. The goal is to be able to add/remove a package without having to
   create the file from scratch, for performance.
