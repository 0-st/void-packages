xbps-src:
 * Personalized scripts per template to unpack distfiles.
 * Multiple URLs to download source distribution files, aliases, etc.
   Something like ${sourceforge} to pick up any specified mirror on the list.
 * Add support to run INSTALL/REMOVE scripts, so that the same actions are
   performed in source/bin packages. [STOPPED]
 * Modify the genindex target to add a single package, without having
   to create it from scratch.

Packages:
 * fix mpfr hardcoded rpath for gmp.
 * Create /etc/issue.
 * Add a trigger for fc-cache.
 * Add a trigger to (un)register users/groups. Currently packages that
   require user/groups use custom INSTALL/REMOVE scripts, which adds
   a lot of duplicated work.
 
xbps-bin:
 * Add support to handle conf_files and keep_dirs from package metadata.
   [PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED]
 * Add support to install binary packages without any repository.
 * Show binpkg size and installed size for all packages that are going
   to be installed before installation happens.
 * Add support to update packages. [IN PROGRESS]
 * Add a flag to reinstall a package version that is already installed,
   overwritting files on disk and updating required_by if required.
   Perhaps change the automatic-install object to false, like pkg_install
   from NetBSD do.

xbps-repo:
 * Replace binpkg-genindex.sh with a target for xbps-repo to generate the
   index. The goal is to be able to add/remove a package without having to
   create the file from scratch, for performance.
 * Add support for remote repositories, requires libfetch.
