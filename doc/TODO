xbps-src:
 * Personalized scripts per template to unpack distfiles.
 * Multiple URLs to download source distribution files, aliases, etc.
   Something like ${sourceforge} to pick up any specified mirror on the list.
 * Add support to run INSTALL/REMOVE scripts, so that the same actions are
   performed in source/bin packages.
 * Use current postinstall_helpers to automatically add triggers, shared
   by src/bin packages.

Packages:
 * fix mpfr hardcoded rpath for gmp.

xbps-bin:
 * Add support to handle conf_files and keep_dirs from package metadata.
   [PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED]
 * Add support to install binary packages without any repository.
 * Show binpkg size and installed size for all packages that are going
   to be installed before installation happens.
 * Add support to update packages.
 * While installing a package, check if version that is going to be
   installed is already installed.

xbps-repo:
 * Replace binpkg-genindex.sh with a target for xbps-repo to generate the
   index. The goal is to be able to add/remove a package without having to
   create the file from scratch, for performance.
 * Add support for remote repositories, requires libfetch.
