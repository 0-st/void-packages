Some stuff that should be done:

* Personalized scripts per template to unpack distfiles.
* Multiple URLs to download source distribution files, aliases, etc.
  Something like ${sourceforget} to pick up any specified mirror.
* More robust and fast dependency checking.
* wget now is required inside the chroot
  - etc/resolv.conf is copied before entering the chroot
