- Split pkgs with "Add_dependency full" into build and run depends,
  adding -devel pkgs as builddeps. Almost all packages are converted,
  but probably a few remain.

- Make src packages self contained, without requiring to download 
  the whole repository.

- Update documentation for recent changes, i.e building packages in
  the chroot as user via capchroot.

- Add documentation explaining stuff to create build templates.
  Explain extensively available variables, build phases, etc.

- Fix packages with the "XXX" mark.
