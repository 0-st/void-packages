* Create /etc/issue in xbps-base-files.
* Add a trigger for fc-cache.
* Add a trigger to (un)register users/groups. Currently packages that
  require user/groups use custom INSTALL/REMOVE scripts, which adds
  a lot of duplicated work.
* Add support to stop and restart package's OpenRC service while
  removing and upgrading a package.
  [PARTIAL: at pre-remove the services are stopped but not yet restarted]
* How to handle kernel package upgrades? dpkg seems to keep previous
  package and its initramfs, and a dummy package depends on the latest one.
  I think this is the best option.
* Fix initramfs-tools trigger for $pkgname != kernel.
* Fix initramfs-tools 'update-initramfs -a'.
* Fix HAL/PolicyKit for nonroot to be able to admin tasks.
* Fix loadkeys(1) incorrectly loading the olpc keymap vs qwerty.
