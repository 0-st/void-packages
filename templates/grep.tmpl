long_desc="
 GNU grep is based on a fast lazy-state deterministic matcher (about twice
 as fast as stock Unix egrep) hybridized with a Boyer-Moore-Gosper search for
 a fixed string that eliminates impossible text from being considered by the
 full regexp matcher without necessarily having to look at every character.
 The result is typically many times faster than Unix grep or egrep."
