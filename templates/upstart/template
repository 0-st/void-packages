long_desc="
 Upstart is an event-based replacement for the /sbin/init daemon which handles
 starting of tasks and services during boot, stopping them during shutdown
 and supervising them while the system is running.

 It was originally developed for the Ubuntu distribution, but is intended to
 be suitable for deployment in all Linux distributions as a replacement for
 the venerable System-V init."
