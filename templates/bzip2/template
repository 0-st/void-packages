long_desc="
 bzip2 is a freely available, patent free, high-quality data compressor.
 It typically compresses files to within 10%% to 15%% of the best available
 techniques, whilst being around twice as fast at compression and six times
 faster at decompression.

 bzip2 compresses files using the Burrows-Wheeler block-sorting text
 compression algorithm, and Huffman coding. Compression is generally
 considerably better than that achieved by more conventional LZ77/LZ78-based
 compressors, and approaches the performance of the PPM family of statistical
 compressors.

 The archive file format of bzip2 (.bz2) is incompatible with that of its
 predecessor, bzip (.bz)."
