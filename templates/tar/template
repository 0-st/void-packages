 GNU tar, originally shipped as NetBSD's \"tar\" up to version 1.3, is a
 full-featured tar command that can access remote and local magnetic tapes,
 tar files (ustar, POSIX, and V7), and even compressed or gzipped versions
 of these.  Note that as of the current version of GNU tar (1.12), gtar
 does not create "correct" ustar archives."
