 The X Rendering Extension introduces digital image composition as the
 foundation of a rendering model within the X Window System.  Rendering
 geometric figures is accomplished by client-side tessellation into either
 triangles or trapezoids.  Text is drawn by loading glyphs into the server
 and rendering sets of them.

 This package contains the client library for connecting to a Xserver that
 supports the Xrender extension.

 This is the modular X.org X11 project version."
