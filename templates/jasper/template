 The JasPer Project is a collaborative effort between Image Power, Inc.
 and the University of British Columbia. The objective of this project is
 to develop a software-based reference implementation of the codec
 specified in the JPEG-2000 Part-1 standard (i.e., ISO/IEC 15444-1).This
 software has also been submitted to the ISO for inclusion in the JPEG-2000
 Part-5 standard (as an official reference implementation)."
