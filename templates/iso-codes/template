 iso-codes provides the list of the country, language and currency names in
 one place, rather than repeated in many third-party programs. This was
 originally done to centralize this data in Debian systems.

 The aim of iso-codes is to create a single \"gettext\" domain \"iso-639\" which
 contains the translations of language names, and one \"iso-3166\" listing the
 translations of country names."
