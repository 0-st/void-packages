 Mono.Addins is a framework for creating extensible applications, and for
 creating libraries which extend those applications.

 Mono.Addins has been designed to be easy to use and useful for a wide range
 of applications: from simple applications with small extensibility needs,
 to complex applications which need support for large add-in structures.

 This new framework intends to set an standard for building extensible
 applications and add-ins in Mono."
