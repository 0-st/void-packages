long_desc="
 The GNU Readline library provides a set of functions for use by
 applications that allow users to edit command lines as they are
 typed in. Both Emacs and vi editing modes are available. The
 Readline library includes additional functions to maintain a list
 of previously-entered command lines, to recall and perhaps reedit
 those lines, and perform csh-like history expansion on previous
 commands."
