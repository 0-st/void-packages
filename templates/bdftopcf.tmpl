 The bdftopcf tool converts X fonts from Bitmap Distribution Format
 to Portable Compiled Format.

 Fonts in the Portable Compiled Format can be read by any architecture,
 although  the file  is  structured  to allow one particular
 architecture to read them directly without reformatting.  This
 allows fast reading on the  appropriate machine, but the files
 are still portable (but read more slowly) on other machines."
