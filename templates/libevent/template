long_desc="
 The libevent API provides a mechanism to execute a callback function
 when a specific event occurs on a file descriptor or after a timeout
 has been reached. libevent is meant to replace the asynchronous event
 loop found in event driven network servers. An application just needs
 to call event_dispatch() and can then add or remove events dynamically
 without having to change the event loop."
