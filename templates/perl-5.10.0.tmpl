long_desc="
 Perl is a general-purpose programming language originally developed
 for text manipulation and now used for a wide range of tasks including
 system administration, web development, network programming, GUI
 development, and more.  The language is intended to be practical (easy
 to use, efficient, complete) rather than beautiful (tiny, elegant,
 minimal).  Its major features are that it's easy to use, supports both
 procedural and object-oriented (OO) programming, has powerful built-in
 support for text processing, and has one of the world's most impressive
 collections of third-party modules."
