 OpenRC is a dependency based init system that works with the system
 provided init program, normally /sbin/init. It is not a replacement for
 /sbin/init. OpenRC is 100% compatible with Gentoo init scripts, which
 means you can probably find one for the daemons you want to start in the
 Gentoo Portage Tree. OpenRC also provides an init script that runs BSD
 rc.d style scripts too, making it easy to port your BSD system to OpenRC."
