 The bdftopcf tool converts X fonts from Bitmap Distribution Format
 to Portable Compiled Format.

 Fonts in the Portable Compiled Format can be read by any architecture,
 although the file is structured to allow one particular
 architecture to read them directly without reformatting. This
 allows fast reading on the appropriate machine, but the files
 are still portable (but read more slowly) on other machines."
