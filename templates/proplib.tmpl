 The proplib library provides an abstract interface for creating and
 manipulating property lists. Property lists have object types for boolean
 values, opaque data, numbers, and strings. Structure is provided by the
 array and dictionary collection types.

 Property lists can be passed across protection boundaries by translating
 them to an external representation. This external representation is an XML
 document whose format is described by the following DTD:

    http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd 

 This proplib version is the same version than is available on NetBSD, but
 with the exception that NetBSD specific code has been removed and it has
 been converted to be built through the GNU autotools."
