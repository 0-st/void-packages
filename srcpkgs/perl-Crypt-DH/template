long_desc="
 Crypt::DH is a Perl implementation of the Diffie-Hellman key exchange
 system. Diffie-Hellman is an algorithm by which two parties can agree on
 a shared secret key, known only to them. The secret is negotiated over
 an insecure network without the two parties ever passing the actual
 shared secret, or their private keys, between them."
