 Valgrind is a tool to help you find memory-management problems in your
 programs. When a program is run under Valgrind's supervision, all
 reads and writes of memory are checked, and calls to
 malloc/new/free/delete are intercepted. As a result, Valgrind can
 detect a lot of problems that are otherwise very hard to find/diagnose."
