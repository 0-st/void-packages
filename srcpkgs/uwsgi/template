long_desc="
 uWSGI is a fast, self-healing and developer/sysadmin-friendly application
 container server coded in pure C.

 Born as a WSGI-only server, over time it has evolved in a complete stack for
 networked/clustered web applications, implementing message/object passing,
 caching, RPC and process management.

 It uses the uwsgi (all lowercase, already included by default in the Nginx
 and Cherokee releases) protocol for all the networking/interprocess communications,
 but it can speak other protocols as well (http, fastcgi, mongrel2...)"
