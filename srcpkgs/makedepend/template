 Makedepend is a makefile dependency generator from The XFree86 Project, Inc. 

 Makedepend reads each sourcefile in sequence and parses it like a 
 C-preprocessor, processing all include, define, undef, ifdef, ifndef,
 endif, if and else directives so that it can correctly tell which
 include, directives would be used in a compilation. Any include,
 directives can reference files having other include directives, and parsing
 will occur in these files as well."
