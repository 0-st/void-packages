 urlgrabber is a pure python package that drastically simplifies the fetching
 of files. It is designed to be used in programs that need common (but not
 necessarily simple) url-fetching features. It is extremely simple to drop
 into an existing program and provides a clean interface to
 protocol-independant file-access. Best of all, urlgrabber takes care of all
 those pesky file-fetching details, and lets you focus on whatever it is that
 your program is written to do!"
