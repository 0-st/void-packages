  LyX the document processor need a set of TeXLive packages present
  to deploy his power, so you nedd to check if this packages are 
  installed.

  If you have the default (small) installation of TeXLive, you have to
  install them. The quickiest way is to run:

  'tlmgr install algorithm2e algorithms apacite bbding besoz 
      bibtopic breakurl covington csquotes diagbox endnotes enumitem
      epstopdf esint eurosym feyn fragments framed frankenstein 
      harvard hyphenat jurabib lettrine luainputenc marginnote 
      mathdesign mathdots mhchem multirow nicefrac nomencl picinpar 
      pict2e prettyref preview rotfloat rsfs shapepar sidecap splitidx 
      splitindex symbol tex-gyre ulem undertilde units wasy wasysym 
      wrapfig xargs'

   and then run it without --dry-run to install the missing packages.

   To check if some packages are missing under the menu:
   "Help" the choice "Latex Configuration" may give you some help.

   As there are many flavour of your preferred applications, i didn't
   force you to use any in particular so you must have at least:
   a text editor, a PDF viewer, an internet browser.

   If LyX appear on your screen a look in the file:
      '~/.lyx/configure.log'
   may give you an idea of what is supported by LyX.

   Happy LyXing
