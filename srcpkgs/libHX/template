long_desc="
 libHX is a C library (with some C++ bindings available) that provides data
 structures and functions commonly needed, such as maps, deques, linked lists,
 string formatting and autoresizing, option and config file parsing, type
 checking casts and more.

 libHX aids in quickly writing up C and C++ data processing programs, by
 consolidating tasks that often happen to be open-coded, such as (simple)
 config file reading, option parsing, directory traversal, and others, into
 a library. The focus is on reducing the amount of time (and secondarily,
 the amount of code) a developer has to spend for otherwise implementing such."
