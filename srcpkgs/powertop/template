 PowerTOP is a Linux tool that finds the software component(s) that make your
 laptop use more power than necessary while it is idle. As of Linux kernel
 version 2.6.21, the kernel no longer has a fixed 1000Hz timer tick. This will
 (in theory) give a huge power savings because the CPU stays in low power mode
 for longer periods of time during system idle.

 However... there are many things that can ruin the party, both inside the
 kernel and in userspace. PowerTOP combines various sources of information from
 the kernel into one convenient screen so that you can see how well your system
 is doing, and which components are the biggest problem."
