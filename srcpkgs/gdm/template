 GDM is the GNOME Display Manager, it is the little proggie that runs
 in the background, runs your X sessions, presents you with a login box
 and then tells you to piss off because you forgot your password. It
 does pretty much everything that you would want to use xdm for, but
 does not involve as much crack. It doesn't use any code from xdm, and
 has a more paranoid and safer design overall. It also includes many
 features over xdm, the biggest one of which is that it is more user
 friendly, even if your X setup is failing. The goal is that users
 should never, ever have to use the command line to customize or
 troubleshoot gdm. It of course supports xdmcp, and in fact extends
 xdmcp a little bit in places where I thought xdm was lacking (but is
 still compatible with xdm's xdmcp)."
