 bc is an arbitrary precision numeric processing language. Syntax is similar
 to C, but differs in many substantial areas. It supports interactive
 execution of statements. bc is a utility included in the POSIX P1003.2/D11
 draft standard.
 
 Since the POSIX document does not specify how bc must be implemented, this
 version does not use the historical method of having bc be a compiler for the
 dc calculator. This version has a single executable that both compiles the
 language and runs the resulting byte code. The byte code is not the dc
 language."
