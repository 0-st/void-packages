long_desc="
 SCons is a software construction toolâ€”that is, a superior alternative to the
 classic "Make" build tool that we all know and love.

 SCons is implemented as a Python script and set of modules, and SCons
 'configuration files' are actually executed as Python scripts. This gives
 SCons many powerful capabilities not found in other software build tools."
