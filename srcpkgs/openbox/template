 Openbox works with your applications, and makes your desktop easier to
 manage. This is because the approach to its development was the opposite of
 what seems to be the general case for window managers. Openbox was written
 first to comply with standards and to work properly. Only when that was in
 place did the team turn to the visual interface.

 Openbox is fully functional as a stand-alone working environment, or can be
 used as a drop-in replacement for the default window manager in the GNOME
 or KDE desktop environments.

 Some of the things to look for in Openbox are:

  * ICCCM and EWMH compliance!
  * Very fast
  * Chainable key bindings
  * Customizable mouse actions
  * Window resistance
  * Multi-head Xinerama support!
  * Pipe menus"
