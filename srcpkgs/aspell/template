 GNU Aspell is a Free and Open Source spell checker designed to eventually
 replace Ispell. It can either be used as a library or as an independent spell
 checker. Its main feature is that it does a much better job of coming up with
 possible suggestions than just about any other spell checker out there for the
 English language, including Ispell and Microsoft Word. It also has many other
 technical enhancements over Ispell such as using shared memory for dictionaries
 and intelligently handling personal dictionaries when more than one Aspell
 process is open at once."
