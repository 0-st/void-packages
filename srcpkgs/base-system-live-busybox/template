 BusyBox combines tiny versions of many common UNIX utilities into a single
 small executable. It provides replacements for most of the utilities you
 usually find in GNU fileutils, shellutils, etc. The utilities in BusyBox
 generally have fewer options than their full-featured GNU cousins; however,
 the options that are included provide the expected functionality and behave
 very much like their GNU counterparts. BusyBox provides a fairly complete
 environment for any small or embedded system.

 This package is only meant to be installed by vmklive utility and shall
 not be installed into a running system."
