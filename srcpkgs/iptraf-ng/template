 $pkgname is a fork of original iptraf-3.0.0.

 IPTraf-ng is a console-based network monitoring utility. IPTraf-ng gathers
 data like TCP connection packet and byte counts, interface statistics and
 activity indicators, TCP/UDP traffic breakdowns, and LAN station packet
 and byte counts. IPTraf-ng features include an IP traffic monitor which
 shows TCP flag information, packet and byte counts, ICMP details, OSPF
 packet types, and oversized IP packet warnings; interface statistics showing
 IP, TCP, UDP, ICMP, non-IP and other IP packet counts, IP checksum errors,
 interface activity and packet size counts; a TCP and UDP service monitor
 showing counts of incoming and outgoing packets for common TCP and UDP
 application ports, a LAN statistics module that discovers active hosts and
 displays statistics about their activity; TCP, UDP and other protocol
 display filters so you can view just the traffic you want; logging; support
 for Ethernet, FDDI, ISDN, SLIP, PPP, and loopback interfaces; and
 utilization of the built-in raw socket interface of the Linux kernel, so it
 can be used on a wide variety of supported network cards."
