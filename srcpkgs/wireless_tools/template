 The Wireless Tools (WT) is a set of tools allowing to manipulate the
 Wireless Extensions. They use a textual interface and are rather crude,
 but aim to support the full Wireless Extension. There are many other tools
 you can use with Wireless Extensions, however Wireless Tools is the
 reference implementation."
