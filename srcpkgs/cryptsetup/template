long_desc="
 Cryptsetup provides an interface for configuring encryption on block devices
 (such as /home or swap partitions), using the Linux kernel device mapper target
 dm-crypt. It features integrated Linux Unified Key Setup (LUKS) support.

 Cryptsetup is backwards compatible with the on-disk format of cryptoloop, but
 also supports more secure formats. This package includes support for automatically
 configuring encrypted devices at boot time via the config file /etc/crypttab.
 Additional features are cryptoroot support through initramfs-tools and several
 supported ways to read a passphrase or key."
