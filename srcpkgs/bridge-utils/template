long_desc="
 A bridge is a way to connect two Ethernet segments together in a
 protocol independent way. Packets are forwarded based on Ethernet address,
 rather than IP address (like a router). Since forwarding is done at Layer 2,
 all procols can go transparently through a bridge.

 The Linux bridge code implements a subset of the ANSI/IEEE 802.1d standard."
