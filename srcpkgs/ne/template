 Ne, the nice editor, is one of the few text editors being both easy to use for
 the beginner and powerful enough for the wizard, supporting UTF-8 and
 multi-column characters as well as syntax highlighting.

 It uses short, intuitive and easy to remember key bindings while providing all
 the features an editor should have. It is fully configurable allowing the user
 to change the content of the various menus, to easily create small macros and
 to easily change the existing key bindings while being a small and fast editor."
