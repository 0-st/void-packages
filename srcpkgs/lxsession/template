 LXSession is a lightweight X11 session manager with fewer dependencies,
 designed for use with the LXDE (Lightweight X11 Desktop Environment). It
 derived from XSM and have following differences:

 * Removed the session dialog from xsm.
 * Stripped down without session restore function.
 * Automaticlly restart specific program if crashes happened.
 * Use better configuration.
 * Provide a nice logout-dialog with the ability to
   shutdown/reboot/suspend/hibernate via HAL or gdm,

 LXSession has also a built-in lightweight Xsettings daemon, which can
 configure GTK+ themes, keyboard, and mouse for you on session startup."
