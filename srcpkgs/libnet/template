 Libnet is an API to help with the construction and handling of network
 packets.  It provides a portable framework for low-level network
 packet writing and handling (use libnet in conjunction with libpcap and
 you can write some really cool stuff).  Libnet includes packet creation
 at the IP layer and at the link layer as well as a host of supplementary
 and complementary functionality."
