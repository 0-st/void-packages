 CLooG is a free software and library to generate code for scanning Z-polyhedra.
 That is, it finds a code (e.g. in C, FORTRAN...) that reaches each integral
 point of one or more parameterized polyhedra. CLooG has been originally written
 to solve the code generation problem for optimizing compilers based on the
 polytope model. Nevertheless it is used now in various area e.g. to build control
 automata for high-level synthesis or to find the best polynomial approximation of
 a function. CLooG may help in any situation where scanning polyhedra matters.
 While the user has full control on generated code quality, CLooG is designed to
 avoid control overhead and to produce a very effective code."
