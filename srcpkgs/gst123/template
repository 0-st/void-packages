long_desc="
 The program gst123 is designed to be a more flexible command line player in
 the spirit of ogg123 and mpg123, based on gstreamer. It plays all file
 formats gstreamer understands, so if you have a music collection which
 contains different file formats, like flac, ogg and mp3, you can use
 gst123 to play all your music files."
