 libsigc++ implements a full callback system for use in widget
 libraries, abstract interfaces, and general programming. Originally
 part of the Gtk-- widget set, libsigc++ is now a separate library to
 provide for more general use. It is the most complete library of its
 kind with the ability to connect an abstract callback to a class
 method, function, or function object. It contains adaptor classes for
 connection of dissimilar callbacks and has an ease of use unmatched by
 other C++ callback libraries. Libsigc++ is licensed under the GNU
 Library General Public License, LGPL."
