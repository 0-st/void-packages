long_desc="
 High-speed character set detection library.

 libguess employs discrete-finite automata to deduce the character set of the
 input buffer. The advantage of this is that all character sets can be checked
 in parallel, and quickly. Right now, libguess passes a byte to each DFA on the
 same pass, meaning that the winning character set can be deduced as
 efficiently as possible. 

 libguess is fully reentrant, using only local stack memory for DFA operations."
