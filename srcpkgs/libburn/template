long_desc="
 libburn is a library by which preformatted data get onto optical media: CD,
 DVD, BD (Blu-Ray). On Linux it uses either /dev/sgN (on kernel 2.4 with
 ide-scsi) or /dev/srM , /dev/hdX ( on kernel 2.6).

 libburn also offers a facility for reading data blocks from its drives without
 using the normal block device i/o, which has its advantages and disadvantages.
 It seems appropriate, nevertheless, to do writing and reading via the same
 channel. On several Linux systems, the block device driver needs reloading of
 the drive tray in order to make available freshly written data. The libburn
 read function does not need such a reload."
