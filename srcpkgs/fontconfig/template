 Fontconfig is a library for configuring and customizing font access.

 Fontconfig can:
 * discover new fonts when installed automatically, removing a common
   source of configuration problems.
 * perform font name substitution, so that appropriate alternative fonts
   can be selected if fonts are missing.
 * identify the set of fonts required to completely cover a set of
   languages.
 * have GUI configuration tools built as it uses an XML-based
   configuration file (though with autodiscovery, we believe this need is
   minimized).
 * efficiently and quickly find the fonts you need among the set of fonts
   you have installed, even if you have installed thousands of fonts,
   while minimizing memory usage.
 * be used in concert with the X Render Extension and FreeType to
   implement high quality, anti-aliased and subpixel rendered text on a
   display.

 Fontconfig does not:
 * render the fonts themselves (this is left to FreeType or other
   rendering mechanisms).
 * depend on the X Window System in any fashion, so that printer only
   applications do not have such dependencies."
