long_desc="
 This is a filesystem client based on the SSH File Transfer Protocol. Since
 most SSH servers already support this protocol it is very easy to set up:
 i.e. on the server side there's nothing to do. On the client side mounting
 the filesystem is as easy as logging into the server with ssh."
