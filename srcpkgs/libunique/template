long_desc="
 Unique is a library for writing single instance application. If you launch a
 single instance application twice, the second instance will either just quit
 or will send a message to the running instance.

 Unique makes it easy to write this kind of applications, by providing a base
 class, taking care of all the IPC machinery needed to send messages to a
 running instance, and also handling the startup notification side.

 Unique aims to replace the BaconMessageConnection code that has been copied
 by many projects and the code using Bonobo and D-Bus."
