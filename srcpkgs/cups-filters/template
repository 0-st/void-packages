  This distribution contains backends, filters, and other software that was
  once part of the core CUPS distribution but is no longer maintained by
  Apple Inc. In addition it contains additional filters developed
  independently of Apple, especially filters for the PDF-centric printing
  workflow introduced by OpenPrinting."
