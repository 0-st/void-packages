 SWIG is an interface compiler that connects programs written in C and C++
 with scripting languages such as Perl, Python, Ruby, and Tcl. It works by
 taking the declarations found in C/C++ header files and using them to
 generate the wrapper code that scripting languages need to access the
 underlying C/C++ code. In addition, SWIG provides a variety of customization
 features that let you tailor the wrapping process to suit your application."
