long_desc="
 GNU MP is a library for arbitrary precision arithmetic, operating on signed
 integers, rational numbers, and floating point numbers.  It has a rich set
 of functions, and the functions have a regular interface.

 GNU MP is designed to be as fast as possible, both for small operands and for
 huge operands.  The speed is achieved by using fullwords as the basic
 arithmetic type, by using fast algorithms, by carefully optimized assembly
 code for the most common inner loops for a lots of CPUs, and by a general
 emphasis on speed (instead of simplicity or elegance).

 The speed of GNU MP is believed to be faster than any other similar library.
 The advantage for GNU MP increases with the operand sizes for certain
 operations, since GNU MP in many cases has asymptotically faster algorithms."
