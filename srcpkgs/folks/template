long_desc="
 libfolks is a library that aggregates people from multiple sources (eg,
 Telepathy connection managers and eventually evolution data server, Facebook,
 etc.) to create metacontacts. It's written in Vala (in part to evaluate Vala).
 The initial goal is for GObject/C support, though the Vala bindings should
 basically automatic."
