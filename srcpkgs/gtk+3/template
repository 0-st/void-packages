long_desc="
 GTK+ is a multi-platform toolkit for creating graphical user
 interfaces. Offering a complete set of widgets, GTK+ is suitable for
 projects ranging from small one-off tools to complete application
 suites.

 GTK+ has been designed from the ground up to support a range of
 languages, not only C/C++. Using GTK+ from languages such as Perl and
 Python (especially in combination with the Glade GUI builder) provides
 an effective method of rapid application development."
