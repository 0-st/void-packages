 Musepack is an audio compression format with a strong emphasis on high
 quality. It is not lossless, but it is designed for transparency, so that
 you won't be able to hear differences between the original wave file and
 the much smaller MPC file.

 It is based on the MPEG-1 Layer-2 / MP2 algorithms, but since 1997 it has
 rapidly developed and vastly improved and is now at an advanced stage in
 which it contains heavily optimized and patentless code."
