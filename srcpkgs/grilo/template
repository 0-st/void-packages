 More precisely, Grilo provides:

  * A single, high-level API that abstracts the differences among various
    media content providers, allowing application developers to integrate
    content from various services and sources easily.
  * A collection of plugins for accessing content from various media providers.
    Developers can share efforts and code by writing plugins for the framework
    that are application agnostic.
  * A flexible API that allows plugin developers to write plugins of various kinds."
