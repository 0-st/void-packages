 This package contains a base64 encoder/decoder and a quoted-printable
 encoder/decoder. These encoding methods are specified in RFC 2045 -
 MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions).

 The base64 encoding is designed to represent arbitrary sequences of
 octets in a form that need not be humanly readable. A 65-character
 subset ([A-Za-z0-9+/=]) of US-ASCII is used, enabling 6 bits to be
 represented per printable character.

 The quoted-printable encoding is intended to represent data that
 largely consists of bytes that correspond to printable characters in
 the ASCII character set. Non-printable characters are represented by
 a triplet consisting of the character \"=\" followed by two hexadecimal
 digits.

 The MIME::Base64 and MIME::QuotedPrint modules used to be part of
 libwww-perl package. They are now distributed separately (this
 package). The main improvement is that the base64 encoder/decoder is
 implemented by XS functions. This makes it about 20 times faster than
 the old implementation in perl."
