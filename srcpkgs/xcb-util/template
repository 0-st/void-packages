 The xcb-util module provides a number of libraries which sit on top of
 libxcb, the core X protocol library, and some of the extension
 libraries. These experimental libraries provide convenience functions
 and interfaces which make the raw X protocol more usable. Some of the
 libraries also provide client-side code which is not strictly part of
 the X protocol but which have traditionally been provided by Xlib.

 These libraries are currently included, roughly ordered by maturity:

 render-util: Convenience functions for the Render extension.
 aux: Convenient access to connection setup and some core requests.
 atom: Standard core X atom constants and atom caching.
 property: Callback X property-change handling.
 icccm: Both client and window-manager helpers for ICCCM.
 keysyms: Standard X key constants and conversion to/from keycodes.
 event: Callback X event handling.
 image: Port of Xlib's XImage and XShmImage functions.
 wm: Framework for window manager implementation."
