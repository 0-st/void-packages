long_desc="
 GnuPG Made Easy (GPGME) is a library designed to make access to GnuPG easier
 for applications. It provides a High-Level Crypto API for encryption,
 decryption, signing, signature verification and key management. Currently it
 uses GnuPG as its backend but the API isn't restricted to this engine; in fact
 we have already developed a backend for CMS (S/MIME).

 Because the direct use of GnuPG from an application can be a complicated
 programming task, it is suggested that all software should try to use GPGME
 instead. This way bug fixes or improvements can be done at a central place
 and every application benefits from this."
