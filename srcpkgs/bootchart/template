 Bootchart is a tool, usually run at system startup, that collects and graphs
 the CPU and disk load of the system as it works. The output of bootchart is
 an SVG graph. Normally, bootchart is invoked as bootchartd by the kernel
 by passing \"init=/usr/sbin/bootchartd\" to the kernel. Bootchart will then fork
 init off to resume normal system startup, while monitoring and logging
 startup information in the background."
