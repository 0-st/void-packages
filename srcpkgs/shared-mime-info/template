 Many programs and desktops use the MIME system to represent the types of
 files. Frequently, it is necessary to work out the correct MIME type for
 a file. This is generally done by examining the file's name or contents,
 and looking up the correct MIME type in a database.

 For interoperability, it is useful for different programs to use the same
 database so that different programs agree on the type of a file, and new
 rules for determining the type apply to all programs.

 This package contains the core database of common types and the
 update-mime-database command used to extend it."
