long_desc="
 LZO is a portable lossless data compression library written in ANSI
 C. It offers pretty fast compression and very fast decompression.
 Decompression requires no memory.

 In addition there are slower compression levels achieving a quite
 competitive compression ratio while still decompressing at this
 very high speed.

 The LZO algorithms and implementations are copyrighted OpenSource
 distributed under the GNU General Public License."
