 newLISP is a Lisp-like, general-purpose scripting language. It is especially
 well-suited for applications in AI, web search, natural language processing,
 and machine learning. Because of its small resource requirements, newLISP
 is also excellent for embedded systems applications. Most of the functions
 you will ever need are already built in. This includes networking functions,
 support for distributed and parallel processing, and Bayesian statistics."
