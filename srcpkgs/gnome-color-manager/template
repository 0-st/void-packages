 GNOME Color Manager is a session framework that makes it easy to manage, install
 and generate color profiles in the GNOME desktop.

 This project has the following features:

 * Setting output gamma tables (with local brightness and adjustments) to any
   Xrandr output (falling back to the per-screen methods for drivers that do not
   yet support Xrandr 1.3).
 * Setting of settings at session start, and when monitors are hotplugged.
 * Easy install of vendor supplied ICC or ICM files, just by double clicking
   on the file.
 * Easy display calibration using an external calibration device, and scanner
   calibration using a inexpensive IT 8.7 target. For calibration, the ArgyllCMS
   package is required.
 * Integration X11 by setting the per-screen and per-output _ICC_PROFILE atom,
   which makes applications such as the GIMP use a color managed output.
 * Easy to use DBus interface for applications to query what ICC profiles should
   be used for a specific device or device type. This is session activated and
   is only started when it is needed, and quits after a small period of idleness."
