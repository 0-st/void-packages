 Libungif is a giflib-compatible library and tools that saves GIFs using
 an uncompressed algorithm that avoids the Unisys patent on the LZW
 compression algorithm.

 The tools include programs to clip, rotate, scale, and position
 GIF images.  It includes code to dump GIFs to an Epson-compatible printer
 in graphics mode, and several conversion utilities.

 The library includes program-callable entry points for reading and writing
 GIF files, an 8x8 utility font for embedding text in GIFs, and an error
 handler.  GIF manipulation can be done at a relatively low level by
 sequential I/O (which automatically undoes image compression) or at
 a higher level by slurping an entire GIF into allocated core."
