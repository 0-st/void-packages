 ORBit2 is a CORBA 2.4-compliant Object Request Broker (ORB) featuring mature C,
 C++ and Python bindings. Bindings (in various degrees of completeness) are also
 available for Perl, Lisp, Pascal, Ruby, and TCL; others are in-progress. It
 supports POA, DII, DSI, TypeCode, Any, IR and IIOP. Optional features including
 INS and threading are available. ORBit2 is engineered for the desktop
 workstation environment, with a focus on performance, low resource usage, and
 security. The core ORB is written in C, and runs under Linux, UNIX (BSD,
 Solaris, HP-UX, ...), and Windows. ORBit2 is developed and released as open
 source software under GPL/LGPL."
