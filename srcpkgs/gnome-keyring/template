long_desc="
 gnome-keyring is a program that keeps passwords and other secrets for
 users. It is run as a damon in the session, similar to ssh-agent, and
 other applications can locate it by an environment variable.

 The program can manage several keyrings, each with its own master
 password, and there is also a session keyring which is never stored to
 disk, but forgotten when the session ends."
