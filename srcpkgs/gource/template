 Software projects are displayed by Gource as an animated tree with the root
 directory of the project at its centre. Directories appear as branches with
 files as leaves. Developers can be seen working on the tree at the times
 they contributed to the project.

 Currently Gource includes built-in log generation support for Git, Mercurial
 and Bazaar and SVN (as of 0.29). Gource can also parse logs produced by
 several third party tools for CVS repositories."
