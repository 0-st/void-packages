long_desc="
 GStreamer is a streaming media framework, badd on graphs of filters which
 operate on media data. Applications using this library can do anything
 real-time sound processing to playing videos, and just about anything
 else media-related. Its plugin-badd architecture means that new data
 types or processing capabilities can be added simply by installing new
 plug-ins.

 GStreamer Bad Plug-ins is a set of plug-ins that are not up to par
 compared to the rest. They might be close to being good quality, but
 they're missing something - be it a good code review, some documentation,
 a set of tests, a real live maintainer, or some actual wide use."
