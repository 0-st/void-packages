 The Calf project aims at providing a set of high quality open source audio
 plugins for musicians. All the included plugins are designed to be used with
 multitrack software, as software replacement for instruments and guitar stomp
 boxes (and not as single modules in a modular synthesizer, which was a primary
 design goal in some other open source plugin packages)."
