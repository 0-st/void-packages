 Network Configurator is a GTK+ monitor and configuration GUI for dhcpcd.
 It uses dhcpcd-dbus to actually talk to dhcpcd and wpa_supplicant.

 Network Configurator sits in the notification area, it's icon representing
 the overall network state. When attempting to negotiate an address you get
 a nice animation. A notification bubble is also shown per interface state
 change.

 A drop down menu shows available Access Points, which one your connected
 to, if they're encrypted or not and their overall quality. You can click
 on one to configure the PSK or WEP key 0 for it."
