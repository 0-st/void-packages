 This is software provides support for the Tag Image Format (TIFF).
 Included is a library, libtiff, for reading and writing TIFF, a
 collection of tools for doing simple manipulations of TIFF images, and
 documentation on the library and tools. A random assortment of
 TIFF-related software contributed by others is also included.

 The library, along with associated tool programs, should handle most of
 your needs for reading and writing files that follow the 5.0 or 6.0
 TIFF spec. There is also considerable support for some of the more
 esoteric portions of the 6.0 TIFF spec."
