long_desc="
 Suil is a lightweight C library for loading and wrapping LV2 plugin UIs.

 Suil makes it possible to load a UI of any toolkit in a host using any other
 toolkit (assuming the toolkits are both supported by Suil). Hosts do not need
 to build against or link to foreign toolkit libraries to use UIs written with
 that toolkit (Suil performs its magic at runtime using dynamically loaded
 modules). The API is designed such that hosts do not need to explicitly
 support particular toolkits whatsoever - if Suil supports a particular
 toolkit, then all hosts that use Suil will support that toolkit - for free.

 Suil currently supports Gtk 2 and Qt 4, i.e. with Suil a Gtk program can
 embed a Qt plugin UI without depending on Qt, and a Qt program can embed a
 Gtk plugin UI without depending on Gtk."
