 The Parma Polyhedra Library (PPL) provides numerical abstractions especially
 targeted at applications in the field of analysis and verification of complex
 systems. These abstractions include convex polyhedra, defined as the
 intersection of a finite number of (open or closed) halfspaces, each
 described by a linear inequality (strict or non-strict) with rational
 coefficients; some special classes of polyhedra shapes that offer interesting
 complexity/precision tradeoffs; and grids which represent regularly spaced
 points that satisfy a set of linear congruence relations. The library also
 supports finite powersets and products of (any kind of) polyhedra and grids
 and a mixed integer linear programming problem solver using an
 exact-arithmetic version of the simplex algorithm."
