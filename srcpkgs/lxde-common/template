 LXDE (the Lightweight X11 Desktop Environment) is a project aimed to
 provide a new desktop environment which is lightweight and fast.

 It is not designed to be powerful and bloated, but to be usable and slim
 enough, and keep the resource usage low. Different from other desktop
 environments, lxde don't tightly integrate every component. Instead, lxde
 tried to make all components independent, and each of them can be used
 independently with fewer dependencies.

Features:

 - Lightweight, runs with reasonable memory usage
 - Fast, rund well even on older machines produced in 1999
 - Good-looking, GTK+ 2 internationalized user interface
 - Easy-to-use, the user interface is simple, but usable enough
 - Desktop independent (suprise! Every component can be used without LXDE)
 - Standard compliant, follows the specs on freedesktop.org"
