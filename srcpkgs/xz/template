 LZMA is a general purporse compression algorithm designed by Igor
 Pavlov as part of 7-Zip. It provides high compression ratio while
 keeping the decompression speed fast.

 XZ Utils are an attempt to make LZMA compression easy to use on
 free (as in freedom) operating systems. This is achieved by providing
 tools and libraries which are similar to use than the equivalents
 of the most popular existing compression algorithms.

 XZ Utils consist of a few relatively separate parts:
  * xz command line tool has almost identical syntax than gzip
    and bzip2. It makes LZMA easy for average users, but also
    provides advanced options to finetune the compression settings.
  * A few shell scripts make diffing and grepping LZMA compressed
    files easy. The scripts were adapted from gzip and bzip2."
