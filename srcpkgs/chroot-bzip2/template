long_desc="
 bzip2 is a freely available, patent free, high-quality data compressor.
 It typically compresses files to within 10%% to 15%% of the best available
 techniques, whilst being around twice as fast at compression and six times
 faster at decompression.

 bzip2 compresses files using the Burrows-Wheeler block-sorting text
 compression algorithm, and Huffman coding. Compression is generally
 considerably better than that achieved by more conventional LZ77/LZ78-based
 compressors, and approaches the performance of the PPM family of statistical
 compressors.

 The archive file format of bzip2 (.bz2) is incompatible with that of its
 predecessor, bzip (.bz).

 This package is only meant to be used by xbps-src, don't install it manually."
