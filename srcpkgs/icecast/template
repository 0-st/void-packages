 Icecast is a streaming media server which currently supports Ogg Vorbis and
 MP3 audio streams. It can be used to create an Internet radio station or a
 privately running jukebox and many things in between. It is very versatile
 in that new formats can be added relatively easily and supports open
 standards for commuincation and interaction."
