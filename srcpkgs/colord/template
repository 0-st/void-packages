long_desc="
 colord is a system service that makes it easy to manage, install and generate
 color profiles to accurately color manage input and output devices.

 What colord does:
  Provides a D-Bus API for system frameworks to query, e.g. Get me the profiles
  for device foo or Create a device and assign it profile bar.
  Provides a persistent database backed store that is preserved across reboots.
  Provides the session for a way to set system settings, for instance setting
  the display profile for all users and all sessions.

 colord itself is a system activated daemon called colord. Being system
 activated means that it's only started when the user is using a text mode
 or graphical tool."
