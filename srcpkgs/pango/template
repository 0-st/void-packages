 Pango is a library for layout and rendering of text, with an emphasis
 on internationalization. Pango can be used anywhere that text layout
 is needed; however, most of the work on Pango-1.0 was done using the
 GTK+ widget toolkit as a test platform. Pango forms the core of text
 and font handling for GTK+-2.0.

 Pango is designed to be modular; the core Pango layout can be used
 with four different font backends:

  - Core X windowing system fonts
  - Client-side fonts on X using the Xft library
  - Direct rendering of scalable fonts using the FreeType library
  - Native fonts on Microsoft backends

 Dynamically loaded modules then handle text layout for particular
 combinations of script and font backend.

 As well as the low level layout rendering routines, Pango includes
 PangoLayout, a high level driver for laying out entire blocks of text,
 and routines to assist in editing internationalized text."
