 The libxcb package provides a replacement for the current Xlib interface.
 Some of its advantages include:
  - size: small library and lower memory footprint
  - latency hiding: batch several requests and wait for the replies later
  - direct protocol access: one-to-one mapping between interface and protocol
  - proven thread support: transparently access XCB from multiple threads
  - easy extension implementation: interfaces auto-generated from XML-XCB

 Xlib can also use XCB as a transport layer, allowing software to make
 requests and receive responses with both, which eases porting to XCB."
