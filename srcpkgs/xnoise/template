 Unlike Rhythmbox, Banshee or itunes, Xnoise uses a tracklist centric design.
 The tracklist is a list of video or music tracks that are played one by one
 without being removed (right side of window). This gives you the possibility
 to queue any track in any order, regardless if they are on the same album.
 Tracks or groups of tracks can be reordered at any time via drag and drop."
