long_desc="
 GNU SASL is an implementation of the Simple Authentication and Security Layer
 framework and a few common SASL mechanisms. SASL is used by network servers
 (e.g., IMAP, SMTP) to request authentication from clients, and in clients to
 authenticate against servers.

 GNU SASL consists of a library (libgsasl), a command line utility (gsasl) to
 access the library from the shell, and a manual. The library includes support
 for the framework (with authentication functions and application data privacy
 and integrity functions) and at least partial support for the CRAM-MD5,
 EXTERNAL, GSSAPI, ANONYMOUS, PLAIN, SECURID, DIGEST-MD5, SCRAM-SHA-1,
 SCRAM-SHA-1-PLUS, LOGIN, and NTLM mechanisms."
