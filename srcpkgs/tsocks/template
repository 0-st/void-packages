 SOCKS servers are a form of proxy that are commonly used in firewalled LAN
 environments to allow access between networks, and often to the Internet.
 The problem is that most applications don't know how to gain access through
 SOCKS servers. This means that network based applications that don't
 understand SOCKS are very limited in networks they can reach. An example of
 this is simple 'telnet'. If you're on a network firewalled from the internet
 with a SOCKS server for outside access, telnet can't use this server and
 thus can't telnet out to the Internet.

 tsocks' role is to allow these non SOCKS aware applications (e.g telnet, ssh,
 ftp etc) to use SOCKS without any modification. It does this by intercepting
 the calls that applications make to establish network connections and
 negotating them through a SOCKS server as necessary."
