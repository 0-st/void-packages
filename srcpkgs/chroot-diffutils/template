 Diffutils contains the GNU diff, diff3, sdiff, and cmp utilities. Their
 features are a superset of the Unix features and they are significantly
 faster. Cmp has been moved into this package from the GNU textutils package.
 These programs are usually used for creating patch files.

 This package is only meant to be used by xbps-src, don't install it manually."
