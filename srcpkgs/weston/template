long_desc="
 Weston is the reference implementation of a Wayland compositor, and a
 useful compositor in its own right.  Weston has various backends that
 lets it run on Linux kernel modesetting and evdev input as well as
 under X11.  Weston ships with a few example clients, from simple
 clients that demonstrate certain aspects of the protocol to more
 complete clients and a simplistic toolkit.  There is also a quite
 capable terminal emulator (weston-terminal) and an toy/example desktop
 shell.  Finally, weston also provides integration with the Xorg server
 and can pull X clients into the Wayland desktop and act as a X window
 manager."
