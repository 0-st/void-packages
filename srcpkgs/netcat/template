 Netcat is a featured networking utility which reads and writes data across
 network connections, using the TCP/IP protocol.
 It is designed to be a reliable back-end tool that can be used directly or
 easily driven by other programs and scripts. At the same time, it is a
 feature-rich network debugging and exploration tool, since it can create
 almost any kind of connection you would need and has several interesting
 built-in capabilities."
