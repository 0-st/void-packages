=====================================================================

Be sure to run 'regsvr32 wineasio.dll' as your user before use!

You may also override the WINEPREFIX environment variable if your
WINE installation is not installed in ~/.wine/

NOTE: The JACK server must be running in order to load the driver
into an application.
