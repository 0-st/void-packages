 Libvisual is an abstraction library that comes between applications and
 audio visualisation plugins.

 Often when it comes to audio visualisation plugins or programs that create
 visuals they do depend on a player or something else, basically there is no
 general framework that enable application developers to easy access cool
 audio visualisation plugins. Libvisual wants to change this by providing
 an interface towards plugins and applications, through this easy to use
 interface applications can easily access plugins and since the drawing is
 done by the application it also enables the developer to draw the visual
 anywhere he wants."
