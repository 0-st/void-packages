long_desc="
 The binfmt_misc kernel module, contained in versions 2.1.43 and later of the
 Linux kernel, allows system administrators to register interpreters for
 various binary formats based on a magic number or their file extension, and
 cause the appropriate interpreter to be invoked whenever a matching file is
 executed. Think of it as a more flexible version of the \#! executable
 interpreter mechanism.

 This package provides an 'update-binfmts' script with which package
 maintainers can register interpreters to be used with this module without
 having to worry about writing their own init scripts, and which sysadmins
 can use for a slightly higher-level interface to this module."
