 The PCRE library is a set of functions that implement regular expression
 pattern matching using the same syntax and semantics as Perl 5. PCRE
 has its own native API, as well as a set of wrapper functions that
 correspond to the POSIX regular expression API. The PCRE library is free,
 even for building commercial software."
