 Meld is a visual diff and merge tool targeted at developers. Meld helps you
 compare files, directories, and version controlled projects. It provides two
 and three-way comparison of both files and directories, and has support for
 many popular version control systems.

 Meld helps you review code changes and understand patches. It might even help
 you to figure out what is going on in that merge you keep avoiding."
