long_desc="
 cvs2svn is a tool for migrating a CVS repository to Subversion, git, or
 Bazaar. The main design goals are robustness and 100% data preservation.
 cvs2svn can convert just about any CVS repository we've ever seen, including
 gcc, Mozilla, FreeBSD, KDE, GNOME...

 cvs2svn infers what happened in the history of your CVS repository and
 replicates that history as accurately as possible in the target SCM. All
 revisions, branches, tags, log messages, author names, and commit dates are
 converted. cvs2svn deduces what CVS modifications were made at the same time,
 and outputs these modifications grouped together as changesets in the target
 SCM. cvs2svn also deals with many CVS quirks and is highly configurable."
