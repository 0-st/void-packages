 The Digest::MD5 module allows you to use the RSA Data Security Inc. MD5
 Message Digest algorithm from within Perl programs. The algorithm takes as
 input a message of arbitrary length and produces as output a 128-bit
 fingerprint or message digest of the input.
 
 Note that the MD5 algorithm is not as strong as it used to be. It has since
 2005 been easy to generate different messages that produce the same MD5
 digest. It still seems hard to generate messages that produce a given digest,
 but it is probably wise to move to stronger algorithms for applications that
 depend on the digest to uniquely identify a message.

 The Digest::MD5 module provide a procedural interface for simple use, as well
 as an object oriented interface that can handle messages of arbitrary length
 and which can read files directly."
