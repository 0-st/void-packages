long_desc="
 Cairo is a vector graphics library with cross-device output support. Currently
 supported output targets include the X Window System and in-memory image
 buffers. PostScript and PDF file output is planned. Cairo is designed to
 produce identical output on all output media while taking advantage of display
 hardware acceleration when available (eg. through the X Render Extension).

 Cairo provides a stateful user-level API with capabilities similar to the PDF
 1.4 imaging model. Cairo provides operations including stroking and filling
 Bezier cubic splines, transforming and compositing translucent images, and
 antialiased text rendering."
