long_desc="
 LADI Session Handler or simply ladish is a session management system for JACK
 applications on GNU/Linux. Its aim is to allow you to have many different audio
 programs running at once, to save their setup, close them down and then easily
 reload the setup at some other time.

 ladish does not deal with any kind of audio or MIDI data itself; it just runs
 programs, deals with saving/loading (arbitrary) data and connects JACK ports
 together. It can also be used to move entire sessions between computers, or
 post sessions on the Internet for download."
