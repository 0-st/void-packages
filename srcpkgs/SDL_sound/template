 SDL_sound is a library that handles the decoding of several popular sound
 file formats, such as .WAV and .MP3. It is meant to make the programmer's
 sound playback tasks simpler. The programmer gives SDL_sound a filename, or
 feeds it data directly from one of many sources, and then reads the decoded
 waveform data back at her leisure. If resource constraints are a concern,
 SDL_sound can process sound data in programmer-specified blocks. Alternately,
 SDL_sound can decode a whole sound file and hand back a single pointer to the
 whole waveform. SDL_sound can also handle sample rate, audio format, and
 channel conversion on-the-fly and behind-the-scenes, if the programmer desires."
