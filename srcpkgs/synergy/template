 Synergy is Free and Open Source Software that lets you easily share your
 mouse and keyboard between multiple computers, where each computer has its
 own display. No special hardware is required, all you need is a local area
 network. Synergy is supported on Windows, Mac OS X and Linux. Redirecting
 the mouse and keyboard is as simple as moving the mouse off the edge of your
 screen. Synergy is released under the GNU Public License (GPL)."
