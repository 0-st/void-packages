long_desc="
 cogl is a small open source library for using 3D graphics hardware for
 rendering. The API departs from the flat state machine style of OpenGL and is
 designed to make it easy to write orthogonal components that can render without
 stepping on each others toes.

 As well as aiming for a nice API, we think having a single library as opposed
 to an API specification like OpenGL has a few advantages too; like being
 able to paper over the inconsistencies/bugs of different OpenGL
 implementations in a centralized place, not to mention the myriad of OpenGL
 extensions. It also means we are in a better position to provide utility
 APIs that help software developers since they only need to be implemented
 once and there is no risk of inconsistency between implementations.

 Having other backends, besides OpenGL, such as drm, Gallium or D3D are
 options we are interested in for the future."
