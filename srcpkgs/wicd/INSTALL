=====================================================================

Please note that wicd does not require to have dhcpcd and/or
wpa_supplicant services running at boot. If you are using them at
boot, please disable them before using wicd. You can do that with:

$ /etc/init.d/<service> stop
$ rc-update del <service> default

ATTENTION: to make wicd work for your user, it must be a member
of the 'users' group.
