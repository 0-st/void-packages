 extundelete is a utility that can recover deleted files from an ext3 or ext4
 partition. The ext3 file system is the most common file system when using
 Linux, and ext4 is its successor. extundelete uses the information stored
 in the partition's journal to attempt to recover a file that has been
 deleted from the partition."
