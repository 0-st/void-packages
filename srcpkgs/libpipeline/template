 libpipeline is a C library for setting up and running pipelines of
 processes, without needing to involve shell command-line parsing which is
 often error-prone and insecure.  This alleviates programmers of the need to
 laboriously construct pipelines using lower-level primitives such as fork(2)
 and execve(2)."
