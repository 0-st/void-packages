 Qtractor is an Audio/MIDI multi-track sequencer application written in C++
 with the Qt4 framework. Target platform is Linux, where the Jack Audio
 Connection Kit (JACK) for audio, and the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture
 (ALSA) for MIDI, are the main infrastructures to evolve as a fairly-featured
 Linux desktop audio workstation GUI, specially dedicated to the personal
 home-studio."
