 Rsync is a fast and extraordinarily versatile file copying tool for
 both remote and local files.

 Rsync uses a delta-transfer algorithm which provides a very fast method
 for bringing remote files into sync.  It does this by sending just the
 differences in the files across the link, without requiring that both
 sets of files are present at one of the ends of the link beforehand.  At
 first glance this may seem impossible because the calculation of diffs
 between two files normally requires local access to both files."
