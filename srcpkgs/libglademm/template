 Libglade is a library that performs a similar job to the C source
 output routines in the GLADE user interface builder. Whereas GLADE's
 output routines create C code that can then be compiled, libglade builds
 the interface from an XML file (GLADE's save format) at runtime. This
 way you can change the look of a program without needing to recompile.

 Currently it supports all the widgets in current releases, together
 with support for keyboard accelerators and automatic signal
 connection.

 This is the gtkmm2 binding"
