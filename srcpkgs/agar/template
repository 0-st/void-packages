long_desc="
 Agar is a modern open-source, cross-platform toolkit for graphical
 applications implemented in C, C++, Perl and Ada (with bindings to other
 languages in development). Designed for ease of integration, it follows
 the philosophy of building the GUI around the application and not the other
 way around. Unlike most other GUI toolkits, Agar takes maximum advantage of
 hardware graphics acceleration when it is available via OpenGL, but it also
 supports traditional framebuffer interfaces such as SDL direct video. The
 Agar API is entirely thread-safe when Agar is compiled with optional threads
 support."
