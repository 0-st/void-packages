long_desc="
 Mutter is a small window manager, using GTK+ and Clutter to do everything.

 Mutter is the clutter-based evolution of Metacity, which, as the author says,
 is a 'Boring window manager for the adult in you. Many window managers are
 like Marshmallow Froot Loops; Metacity is like Cheerios.'"
