 Simple Scan is an easy-to-use application, designed to let users connect their
 scanner and quickly have the image/document in an appropriate format.
 Simple Scan is basically a frontend for SANE - which is the same backend as
 XSANE uses. This means that all existing scanners will work and the interface
 is well tested."
