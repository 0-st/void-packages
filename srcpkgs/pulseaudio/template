long_desc="
 PulseAudio, previously known as Polypaudio, is a sound server for POSIX and
 WIN32 systems. It is a drop in replacement for the ESD sound server with much
 better latency, mixing/re-sampling quality and overall architecture.

 These are some of PulseAudio's features:

  * High quality software mixing of multiple audio streams with support for
    more than one sink/source. May be used to combine multiple sound cards
    into one (with sample rate adjustment).

  * Wide range of supported client libraries. ESD, ALSA, oss, libao and
    GStreamer client applications are supported as-is. Native PulseAudio
    plug-ins are also available for xmms and mplayer.

  * Good low latency behaviour and very accurate latency measurement for
    playback and recording. Ability to fully synchronize multiple playback
    streams.

  * Network transparency, allowing an application to play back or record
    audio on a different machine than the one it is running on.

  * Extensible plug-in architecture with plug-ins for jackd, multicast-rtp
    lirc and avahi, just to name a few."
