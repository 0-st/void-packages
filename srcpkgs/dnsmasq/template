long_desc="
 Dnsmasq is a lightweight, easy to configure DNS forwarder and DHCP server.
 It is designed to provide DNS and, optionally, DHCP, to a small network. It
 can serve the names of local machines which are not in the global DNS.
 The DHCP server integrates with the DNS server and allows machines with
 DHCP-allocated addresses to appear in the DNS with names configured either in
 each host or in a central configuration file. Dnsmasq supports static and
 dynamic DHCP leases and BOOTP/TFTP/PXE for network booting of diskless machines."
