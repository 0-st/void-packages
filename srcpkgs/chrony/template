 It consists of a pair of programs: chronyd. This is a daemon which runs in
 background on the system. It obtains measurements (e.g. via the network) of
 the system's offset relative to other systems, and adjusts the system time
 accordingly. For isolated systems, the user can periodically enter the
 correct time by hand (using chronyc). In either case, chronyd determines the
 rate at which the computer gains or loses time, and compensates for this.
 Chronyd implements the NTP protocol and can act as either a client or a
 server. chronyc: this is a command-line driven control and monitoring program.
 An administrator can use this to fine-tune various parameters within the
 daemon, add or delete servers etc whilst the daemon is running."
