 Foomatic is a printing system designed to make it easier to set up common
 printers for use with Linux (and other operating systems). It provides the
 "glue" between a print spooler (like CUPS or lpr) and your actual printer,
 by telling your computer how to process files sent to the printer.

 This package contains the architecture-dependent programs needed to set up
 and maintain the foomatic system. You will also need one or more database
 packages. The foomatic-db package includes drivers for most common printers
 using Ghostscript as the print processor, as well as some common glue code
 used in other filter systems."
