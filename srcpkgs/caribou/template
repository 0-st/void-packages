 Caribou is a text entry and UI navigation application being developed as an
 alternative to the Gnome On-screen Keyboard. The overarching goal for Caribou
 is to create a usable solution for people whose primary way of accessing a
 computer is a switch device.

 The initial goal is to make an in-place on-screen keyboard suitable for people
 who can use a mouse but not a hardware keyboard. This on-screen keyboard may
 also be useful for touch screen or tablet users."
