 Matroska aims to become THE Standard of Multimedia Container Formats.
 It was derived from a project called MCF, but differentiates from it
 significantly. It is based on EBML (Extensible Binary Meta Language),
 a binary derivative of XML.

 Matroska is designed with the future in mind. It incorporates features
 you would expect from a modern container format, like:

  - Streamable over internet (HTTP and RTP)
  - Fast seeking in the file
  - High error recovery
  - Menus (like DVDs have)
  - Chapter entries
  - Selectable subtitle streams
  - Selectable audio streams
  - Modularly extendable"
