long_desc="
 Epiphany is a simple yet powerful GNOME web browser targeted at non-technical
 users. Its principles are simplicity and standards compliance. Simplicity is
 achieved by a well designed user interface and reliance on external
 applications for performing external tasks (such as reading email). Simplicity
 should not mean less powerful. Standards compliance is achieved on the HTML
 side by using the WebKitGTK+ rendering engine; and on the user interface side
 by closely following the GNOME Human Interface Guidelines (HIG) and by close
 integration with the GNOME desktop.

 This package contains some extensions for use with Epiphany."
