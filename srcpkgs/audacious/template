 Audacious is an open source audio player. A descendant of XMMS, Audacious plays
 your music how you want it, without stealing away your computers resources
 from other tasks. Drag and drop folders and individual song files, search for
 artists and albums in your entire music library, or create and edit your own
 custom playlists. Listen to CDs or stream music from the Internet. Tweak the
 sound with the graphical equalizer or experiment with LADSPA effects. Enjoy the
 modern GTK-themed interface or change things up with Winamp classic skins. Use
 the plugins included with Audacious to fetch lyrics for your music, to set an
 alarm in the morning, and more."
