 The ConnMan project provides a daemon for managing internet connections
 within embedded devices running the Linux operating system. The Connection
 Manager is designed to be slim and to use as few resources as possible,
 so it can be easily integrated. It is a fully modular system that can be
 extended, through plug-ins, to support all kinds of wired or wireless
 technologies. Also, configuration methods, like DHCP and domain name
 resolving, are implemented using plug-ins. The plug-in approach allows for
 easy adaption and modification for various use cases.

 This provides a GTK+2 frontend for connman."
