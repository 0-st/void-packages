 CLucene is a high-performance, scalable, cross platform, full-featured,
 open-source indexing and searching API. Specifically, CLucene is the guts
 of a search engine, the hard stuff. You write the easy stuff: the UI and
 the process of selecting and parsing your data files to pump them into the
 search engine yourself, and any specialized queries to pull it back for
 display or further processing."
