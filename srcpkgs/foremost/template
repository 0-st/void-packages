 Foremost is a console program to recover files based on their headers, footers,
 and internal data structures. This process is commonly referred to as data
 carving. Foremost can work on image files, such as those generated by dd,
 Safeback, Encase, etc, or directly on a drive. The headers and footers can be
 specified by a configuration file or you can use command line switches to
 specify built-in file types. These built-in types look at the data structures
 of a given file format allowing for a more reliable and faster recovery."
