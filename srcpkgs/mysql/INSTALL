PLEASE REMEMBER TO SET A PASSWORD FOR THE MySQL root USER
To do so, start the server with:

	$ /etc/init.d/mysqld start

and then issue the following commands:

	$ mysqladmin -u root password 'new-password'
	$ mysqladmin -u root -h $hostname password 'new-password'

Alternatively you can run:

	$ mysql_secure_installation

which will also give you the option of removing the test
databases and anonymous user created by default. This is
strongly recommended for production servers.

Don't forget that you should also tweak /etc/mysql/my.cnf
for server settings. Additional configuration files are available
in the /usr/share/mysql/my-*.cnf files.
