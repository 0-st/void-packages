long_desc="
 SQLite is a C library that implements an SQL database engine. Programs
 that link with the SQLite library can have SQL database access without
 running a separate RDBMS process. The distribution comes with a standalone
 command-line access program (sqlite) that can be used to administer an
 SQLite database and which serves as an example of how to use the SQLite
 library.

 SQLite is not a client library used to connect to a big database server.
 SQLite is the server. The SQLite library reads and writes directly to and
 from the database files on disk."
