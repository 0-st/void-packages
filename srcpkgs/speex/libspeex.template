 Speex is an audio codec especially designed for compressing voice at low
 bit-rates for applications such as voice over IP (VoIP). In some senses, it
 is meant to be complementary to the Vorbis codec which places a greater
 emphasis on high-quality music reproduction.

 This package contains the Speex runtime shared libraries."
