long_desc="
 GNU m4 is an implementation of the traditional UNIX macro
 processor. It is mostly SVR4 compatible, although it has some
 extensions (for example, handling more than 9 positional parameters to
 macros). m4 also has builtin functions for including files, running
 shell commands, doing arithmetic, etc. Autoconf needs GNU m4 for
 generating configure scripts, but not for running them.

 This package is only meant to be used by xbps-src, don't install it manually."
