 Glade is a RAD tool to enable quick &amp; easy development of user interfaces
 for the GTK+ toolkit and the GNOME desktop environment.

 The user interfaces designed in Glade are saved as XML, and by using the
 GtkBuilder GTK+ object these can be loaded by applications dynamically as
 needed.

 By using GtkBuilder, Glade XML files can be used in numerous programming
 languages including C, C++, C#, Vala, Java, Perl, Python and others."
