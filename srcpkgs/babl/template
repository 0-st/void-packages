 babl is a dynamic, any to any, pixel format translation library.

 It allows converting between different methods of storing pixels known
 as pixel formats that have with different bitdepths and other data
 representations, color models and component permutations.

 A vocabulary to formulate new pixel formats from existing primitives is
 provided as well as the framework to add new color models and data types."
