long_desc="
 Liboil is a library of simple functions that are optimized for various CPUs.
 These functions are generally loops implementing simple algorithms, such as
 converting an array of N integers to floating-poing numbers or multiplying
 and summing an array of N numbers. Clearly such functions are candidates for
 significant optimization using various techniques, especially by using
 extended instructions provided by modern CPUs (Altivec, MMX, SSE, etc.)."
