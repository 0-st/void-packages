- TeXLive is free software see the files:

  in /opt/texlive-installer/LICENSE.TL
  in /opt/texlive-installer/LICENSE.CTAN

  install-tl is smart enough to guess your architecture during the 
  installation.
   
  The template take care of adding the installation PATH of texlive 
  in /etc/profile.d/texlive.sh.

  Setting it /opt/texlive/????/bin/<arch> where ???? is the year of 
  the TeXLive version and arch is:
    - X86_64-linux  ==> voidlinux X86_64 architecture
    - i386-linux    ==> voidlinux i386 architecture
    		 		 
  At the next reboot the PATH is correct, if you want you can type

  $ sudo source /etc/profile

  check if it is ok with:

  $ printenv
