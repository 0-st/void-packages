long_desc="
 GStreamer is a streaming media framework, based on graphs of filters which
 operate on media data. Applications using this library can do anything
 real-time sound processing to playing videos, and just about anything
 else media-related. Its plugin-based architecture means that new data
 types or processing capabilities can be added simply by installing new
 plug-ins.

 This package contains a set of well-maintained base plug-ins."
