long_desc="
 Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming language
 that combines remarkable power with very clear syntax. For an introduction
 to programming in Python you are referred to the Python Tutorial. The Python
 Library Reference documents built-in and standard types, constants, functions
 and modules. Finally, the Python Reference Manual describes the syntax and
 and semantics of the core language in (perhaps too) much detail.

 Python's basic power can be extended with your own modules written in C or
 C++. On most systems such modules may be dynamically loaded. Python is also
 adaptable as an extension language for existing applications."
