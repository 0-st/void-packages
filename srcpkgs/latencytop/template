 Skipping audio, slower servers, everyone knows the symptoms of latency. But to know
 what's going on in the system, what's causing the latency, how to fix it... that's
 a hard question without good answers right now.

 LatencyTOP is a Linux tool for software developers (both kernel and userspace),
 aimed at identifying where in the system latency is happening, and what kind of
 operation/action is causing the latency to happen so that the code can be changed
 to avoid the worst latency hiccups."
