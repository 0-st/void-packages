 This is poppler, a PDF rendering library. It is a fork of the xpdf
 3.0 PDF viewer developed by Derek Noonburg of Glyph and Cog, LLC.

 Poppler provides PDF rendering functionality as a shared library,
 to centralize the maintenence effort and to reduce duplicated
 effort. And the poppler developers would like to move libpoppler
 forward in a number of areas that doesn't fit within the goals of
 xpdf."
