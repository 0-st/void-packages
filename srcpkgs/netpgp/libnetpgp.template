 The netpgp library is a BSD-licensed library for managing PGP keys.

 On top of the library, the netpgp command can digitally sign files and
 verify that the signatures attached to files were signed by a given user
 identifier. netpgp can also encrypt files using the public or private
 keys of users and, in the same manner, decrypt files which were encrypted."
