long_desc="
 The libwww-perl collection is a set of Perl modules which provides a simple
 and consistent application programming interface (API) to the World-Wide Web.
 The main focus of the library is to provide classes and functions that allow
 you to write WWW clients. The library also contain modules that are of more
 general use and even classes that help you implement simple HTTP servers.
 
 Most modules in this library provide an object oriented API. The user agent,
 requests sent and responses received from the WWW server are all represented
 by objects. This makes a simple and powerful interface to these services. The
 interface is easy to extend and customize for your own needs."
