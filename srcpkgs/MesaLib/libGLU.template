 GLU offers simple interfaces for building mipmaps; checking for the presence
 of extensions in the OpenGL (or other libraries which follow the same
 conventions for advertising extensions); drawing piecewise-linear curves,
 NURBS, quadrics and other primitives (including, but not limited to,
 teapots); tesselating surfaces; setting up projection matrices and
 unprojecting screen coordinates to world coordinates."
