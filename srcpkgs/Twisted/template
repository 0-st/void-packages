 Twisted is an event-based framework for internet applications which works on
  Python 2.4 through 2.6. The following are some of the modules included
  with Twisted:

  - twisted.application
    A "Service" system that allows you to organize your application in
    hierarchies with well-defined startup and dependency semantics,
  - twisted.cred
    A general credentials and authentication system that facilitates
    pluggable authentication backends,
  - twisted.enterprise
    Asynchronous database access, compatible with any Python DBAPI2.0
    modules,
  - twisted.internet
    Low-level asynchronous networking APIs that allow you to define
    your own protocols that run over certain transports,
  - twisted.manhole
    A tool for remote debugging of your services which gives you a
    Python interactive interpreter,
  - twisted.protocols
    Basic protocol implementations and helpers for your own protocol
    implementations,
  - twisted.python
    A large set of utilities for Python tricks, reflection, text
    processing, and anything else,
  - twisted.spread
    A secure, fast remote object system,
  - twisted.trial
    A unit testing framework that integrates well with Twisted-based code."
