 Irqbalance is the Linux utility tasked with making sure that interrupts from
 your hardware devices are handled in as efficient a manner as possible
 (meaning every cpu handles some of the interrupt work), while at the same time
 making sure that no single cpu is tasked with a inappropriately large amount
 of this work. Irqbalance constantly analyzes the amuont of work interrupts
 require on your system and balances interrupt handling across all of your
 systems cpus in a fair manner, keeping system performance more predictable and
 constant. This should all happen transparently to the user. If irqbalance
 performs its job right, nobody will ever notice it's there or want to turn it
 off."
