 Skype is a proprietary voice over Internet Protocol service and software
 application originally created by Niklas Zennstr√∂m and Janus Friis, and
 owned by Microsoft since 2011.
 
 The service allows users to communicate with peers by voice, video, and
 instant messaging over the Internet. Phone calls may be placed to recipients
 on the traditional telephone networks. Calls to other users within the Skype
 service are free of charge, while calls to landline telephones and mobile
 phones are charged via a debit-based user account system. Skype has also
 become popular for its additional features, including file transfer, and
 videoconferencing. Competitors include SIP and H.323-based services, such as
 Empathy, Linphone, Ekiga as well as the Google Talk service."
