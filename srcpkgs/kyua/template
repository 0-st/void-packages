 Kyua (pronounced Q.A.) is a testing framework for both developers and users.
 Kyua is different from most other testing frameworks in that it puts the end
 user experience before anything else. There are multiple reasons for users to
 run the tests themselves, and Kyua ensures that they can do so in the most
 convenient way."
