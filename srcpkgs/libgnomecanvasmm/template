 This is the canvas widget library for GNOME2. Libgnomecanvas was
 originally part of the gnome-libs package, but has been split out into
 a separate package for GNOME2.

 The GNOME canvas is an engine for structured graphics that offers a rich
 imaging model, high performance rendering, and a powerful, high-level API.
 It offers a choice of two rendering back-ends, one based on Xlib for
 extremely fast display, and another based on Libart, a sophisticated,
 antialiased, alpha-compositing engine. Applications have a choice between
 the Xlib imaging model or a superset of the PostScript imaging model,
 depending on the level of graphic sophistication required.

 This is the gtkmm2 binding."
