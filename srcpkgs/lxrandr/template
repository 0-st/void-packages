 This is a very basic monitor config tool utilizing the X extension called
 RandR. It can let you change the screen resolution on the fly. Besides, when
 you run lxrandr with external monitor connected, its GUI will change, and
 show you some quick options to get your projector or external monitor working
 correctly.

 LXRandR only gives you some easy and quick options which are intuitive. It\'s
 very suitable for laptop users who frequently uses projectors or external
 monitor and just want to get their work done without reading a lot of 
 geek-centered manuals or command line tutorials."
