 FreeType is a portable, high-quality software solution for digital
 typography.  FreeType 1.3.1 was the last release of the FreeType 1
 engine, as the project is now switching to a new version dubbed FreeType
 2.  It has, among other things, several advantages over FreeType 1:

  * A universal and simple API to manage font files
  * Support for several font formats through loadable drivers
  * Even more portable
  * An improved anti-aliasing algorithm"
