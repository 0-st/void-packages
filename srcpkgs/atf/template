 The Automated Testing Framework (ATF) is a collection of libraries and
 utilities designed to ease unattended application testing in the hands
 of developers and end users of a specific piece of software.

 As regards developers, ATF provides the necessary means to easily create
 test suites composed of multiple test programs, which in turn are a
 collection of test cases. It also attempts to simplify the debugging of
 problems when these test cases detect an error by providing as much
 information as possible about the failure.

 As regards users, it simplifies the process of running the test suites
 and, in special, encourages end users to run them often: they do not need
 to have source trees around nor any other development tools installed to
 be able to certify that a given piece of software works on their machine
 as advertised."
