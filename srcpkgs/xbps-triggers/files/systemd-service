The service "${_srv}" has been enabled by default,
that means that it will be started in next boot. To start it immediately,
execute the following command (as root):

	$ systemctl start ${_srv}

And to stop it:

	$ systemctl stop ${_srv}

Refer to the systemd documentation if more information is required.
