 GStreamer is a library for constructing of graphs of media-handling components.
 The use cases it covers range from simple Ogg/Vorbis playback, audio/video
 streaming to complex audio (mixing) and video (non-linear editing) processing.

 Applications can take advantage of advances in codec and filter technology
 transparently. Developers can add new codecs and filters by writing a simple
 plugin with a clean, generic interface."
