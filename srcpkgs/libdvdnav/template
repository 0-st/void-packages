 libdvdnav is a library that allows easy use of sophisticated DVD navigation
 features such as DVD menus, multiangle playback and even interactive DVD
 games. All this functionality is provided through a simple API which
 provides the DVD playback as a single logical stream of blocks, intermitted
 by special dvdnav events to report certain conditions. The main usage of
 libdvdnav is a loop regularly calling a function to get the next block,
 surrounded by additional calls to tell the library of user interaction.
 The whole DVD virtual machine and internal playback states are completely
 encapsulated."
