long_desc="
 libpeas is a gobject-based plugins engine, and is targetted at giving every
 application the chance to assume its own extensibility. It is currently used by
 several Gnome applications like gedit and Totem.

 It takes its roots in the old gedit plugins engine, and provides an extensive set
 of features mirroring the desiderata of most of the applications providing an
 extension framework."
