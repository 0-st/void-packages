 It provides a GLib-based library, libnice and a Glib-free library, libstun
 as well as GStreamer elements.

 ICE is useful for applications that want to establish peer-to-peer UDP data
 streams. It automates the process of traversing NATs and provides security
 against some attacks. It also allows applications to create reliable streams
 using a TCP over UDP layer.

 Existing standards that use ICE include Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
 and XMPP Jingle."
