long_desc="
 The sdparm utility accesses SCSI device parameters. When the SCSI device is a
 disk, sdparm's role is similar to its namesake: the Linux hdparm utility which
 is primarily designed for ATA disks that had device names starting with "hd".
 More generally sdparm can be used to access parameters on any device that uses
 a SCSI command set. Apart from SCSI disks, such devices include CD/DVD drives
 (irrespective of transport), SCSI and ATAPI tape drives and SCSI enclosures.
 A small set of commands associated with starting and stopping the media,
 loading and unloading removable media and some other housekeeping functions
 can also be sent with this utility."
