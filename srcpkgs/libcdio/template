long_desc="
 This library is to encapsulate CD-ROM reading and
 control. Applications wishing to be oblivious of the OS- and
 device-dependent properties of a CD-ROM can use this library.

 Some support for disk image types like BIN/CUE and NRG is available,
 so applications that use this library also have the ability to read
 disc images as though they were CDs."
