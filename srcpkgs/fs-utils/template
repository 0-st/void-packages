 The aim of this project is to have a set of utilities to access and modify a
 file system image without having to mount it. To use fs-utils you do not
 have to be root, you just need read/write access to the image or device.
 The advantage of fs-utils over similar projects such as mtools is supporting
 the usage of familiar Unix tools (ls, cp, mv, etc.) for a large number of
 file systems."
