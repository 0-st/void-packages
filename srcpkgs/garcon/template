 This is garcon, a freedesktop.org compliant menu implementation based
 on GLib and GIO. It was started as a complete rewrite of the former
 Xfce menu library called libxfce4menu, which, in contrast to garcon,
 was lacking menu merging features essential for loading menus modified
 with menu editors."
