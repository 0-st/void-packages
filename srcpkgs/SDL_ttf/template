long_desc="
 SDL_ttf is a TrueType font rendering library that is used with the SDL
 library, and almost as portable. It depends on freetype2 to handle the
 TrueType font data. It allows a programmer to use multiple TrueType fonts
 without having to code a font rendering routine themselves. With the power
 of outline fonts and antialiasing, high quality text output can be obtained
 without much effort."
