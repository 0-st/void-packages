long_desc="
 The MPFR library is a C library for multiple-precision floating-point
 computations with correct rounding. MPFR has continuously been supported
 by the INRIA and the current main authors come from the CACAO and Ar√©naire
 project-teams at Loria (Nancy, France) and LIP (Lyon, France) respectively;
 see more on the credit page. MPFR is based on the GMP multiple-precision
 library."
