 RawTherapee is used to adjust some of the most often changed parameters when
 optimizing digital images. A normal user often just wants to adjust the white
 balance or brightness of a photo he took. Instead of using a big and expensive
 image editor you could use a small and fast tool like RawTherapee. More and more
 cameras also support RAW formats. RAW files usually offer higher color depth than
 JPGs. So the adjustments are done with the high color depth and then afterwards
 converted to or saved as JPGs. RawTherapee supports JPG, PNG and TIFF. All image
 processing is done in 16 bit/channel mode. Different to other RAW converters it
 can use EAHD as demosaicing algorithm. The raw loading engine of RawTherapee is
 based on dcraw."
