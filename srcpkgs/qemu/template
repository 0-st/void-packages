long_desc="
 QEMU is a generic and open source machine emulator and virtualizer.

 When used as a machine emulator, QEMU can run OSes and programs made for
 one machine (e.g. an ARM board) on a different machine (e.g. your own PC).
 By using dynamic translation, it achieves very good performances.

 When used as a virtualizer, QEMU achieves near native performances by
 executing the guest code directly on the host CPU. A host driver called the
 QEMU accelerator (also known as KQEMU) is needed in this case. The
 virtualizer mode requires that both the host and guest machine use x86
 compatible processors."
