long_desc="
 OpenAL is a cross-platform 3D audio API appropriate for use with gaming
 applications and many other types of audio applications.

 The library models a collection of audio sources moving in a 3D space that
 are heard by a single listener somewhere in that space. The basic OpenAL
 objects are a Listener, a Source, and a Buffer. There can be a large number
 of Buffers, which contain audio data. Each buffer can be attached to one or
 more Sources, which represent points in 3D space which are emitting audio.
 There is always one Listener object (per audio context), which represents
 the position where the sources are heard -- rendering is done from the
 perspective of the Listener."
