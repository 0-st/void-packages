long_desc="
 gtkmm (previously known as Gtk--) is the official C++ interface for the
 popular GUI library GTK+. Highlights include typesafe callbacks, widgets
 extensible via inheritance and a comprehensive set of widget classes that
 can be freely combined to quickly create complex user interfaces. Here's
 an overview, with documentation and status. gtkmm is free software
 distributed under the GNU Library General Public License (LGPL).

 Aside from the C++ interface to Gtk 3.x, this package also provides
 bindings for the ATK library."
