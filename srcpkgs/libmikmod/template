 The MikMod sound library is an excellent way for a programmer to
 add music and sound effects to an application. It is a powerful
 and flexible library, with a simple and easy-to-learn API.

 Besides, the library is very portable and runs under a lot of
 Unices, as well as under OS/2, MacOS and Windows. Third party
 individuals also maintain ports on other systems, including MS-DOS,
 and BeOS.

 MikMod is able to play a wide range of module formats, as well as
 digital sound files. It can take advantage of particular features
 of your system, such as sound redirection over the network. And
 due to its modular nature, the library can be extended to support
 more sound or module formats, as well as new hardware or other
 sound output capabilities, as they appear."
