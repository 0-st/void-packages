long_desc="
 GNOME Power Manager is a session daemon for the GNOME desktop that takes care
 of system or desktop events related to power, and triggers actions
 accordingly. Its philosophy is to completely hide these complex tasks and only
 show some settings important to the user.

 The GNOME power manager displays and manages battery status, power plug events,
 display brightness, CPU, graphics card and hard disk drive power saving, and can
 trigger suspend-to-RAM, hibernate or shutdown events, all integrated to other
 components of the GNOME desktop."
