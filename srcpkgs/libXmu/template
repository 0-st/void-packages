long_desc="
 This Xmu library contains miscellaneous utilities and is not part of the
 Xlib standard.  It contains routines which only use public interfaces
 so that it may be layered on top of any proprietary implementation of
 Xlib or Xt.

 This also includes the Mini Xmu library that does not use Xt and Xaw.

 This is from the modular X.org project."
