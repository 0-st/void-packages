 A set of commands to use the XFS filesystem, including mkfs.xfs.

 XFS is a high performance journaling filesystem which originated on the
 SGI IRIX platform. It is completely multi-threaded, can support large files
 and large filesystems, extended attributes, variable block sizes, is extent
 based, and makes extensive use of Btrees (directories, extents, free space)
 to aid both performance and scalability."
