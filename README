pkgfs - Build packages from s(cratch|ource)

It is a simple package system manager that uses Xstow to allow packages
to be available at a master directory.

Multiple versions of a package can be installed, because they can be enabled
or disabled at the master directory anytime, to e.g allow testing different
versions of the same package by "stowning" or "unstowning" them.

 HOW TO USE IT
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once you download it, you should edit the configuration file located at the
pkgfs directory. By default it uses the pkgfs directory in your $HOME.

If PKGFS_CONFIG_FILE is not set or specified from the command line with the
-c flag, it will use the location "/usr/local/etc/pkgfs.conf".

Once that you read the "pkgfs.conf" file and configured it, you can start
installing packages by using the command:

	$ pkgfs.sh -c pkgfs.conf install glib-2.18.1

Please note that it's assumed that PKGFS_TEMPLATESDIR is properly defined
and actually contains valid template files.

While installing your first package, if pkgfs couldn't find the Xstow program
specified at the configuration file with PKGFS_XSTOW_CMD, the Xstow package
will be installed and "stowned".

If the package is properly installed, it will be "stowned" automatically.
``stowned´´ means that this package is available in the master directory,
on which ``Xstow´´ has created links from DESTDIR/<pkgname>.

To remove a currently installed (and stowned) package, you can use:

	$ pkgfs.sh -c pkgfs.conf remove glib-2.18.1

Please note that when you remove it, the package will also be removed
from PKGFS_DESTDIR and previously "unstowned".

pkgfs uses some db(1) btree files, to record what packages are currently
"stowned". Once you install successfully or stown a package, the package
will be registered in PKGFS_DESTDIR/.pkgfs-registered-pkg.db.

While "unstowning" a package, it won't be available anymore in the master
directory and therefore it probably won't work if used from
PKGFS_DESTDIR/<pkgname>.

Summary, to stow an already installed package (into PKGFS_DESTDIR/<pkgname>):

	$ pkgfs.sh -c pkgs.conf stow glib-2.18.1

and to unstow an already installed (stowned) package:

	$ pkgfs.sh -c pkgfs.conf unstow glib-2.18.1

You can also print some stuff about any template, e.g:

	$ pkgfs.sh info glib-2.18.1

To list installed (stowned) packages, use this:

	$ pkgfs.sh -c pkgfs.conf list

That's all for now folks. I hope you find it useful, as I do.
