Welcome to the official Vanilla GNU/Linux package git repository.
=================================================================

Vanilla GNU/Linux is a new distribution that uses XBPS as its package system,
The X Binary Package System has been designed from scratch, please visit
http://code.google.com/p/xbps for more information.

Vanilla GNU/Linux is a simple and minimal distribution that can be customized
in many ways, currently there are 1500 packages in this repository that you can
build. There is support for i686 and x86_64 architectures, more
could be added in a future (arm) but it's not a high priority.

When a new XBPS stable version comes out, a new live image is created for
testing purposes with the minimal base system, you can find them at:

Enjoy and happy hacking!
