This repository contains the source package tree to build XBPS binary
packages from sources for Void GNU/Linux.

You can find more info about XBPS and Void GNU/Linux on:

	http://code.google.com/p/xbps

To use this repository the 'xbps-src' utility is required. If you don't use
Void GNU/Linux you can fetch its sources from:

	https://github.com/xtraeme/xbps-src

Or alternatively if you are already using Void and/or XBPS you can install
the binary package with:

	$ xbps-bin -y install xbps-src

Enjoy and happy hacking! meet us at xbps@irc.freenode.net.
