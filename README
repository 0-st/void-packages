Welcome to the official Vanilla GNU/Linux package git repository.
=================================================================

Vanilla GNU/Linux is a new distribution that uses XBPS as its package system,
The X Binary Package System has been designed from scratch, please visit
http://code.google.com/p/xbps for more information.

Vanilla GNU/Linux is a simple and minimal distribution that can be customized
in many ways, currently there are 1500 packages in this repository that you can
build. There is support for i686 and x86_64 architectures, more
could be added in a future (arm) but it's not a high priority.

Some features:
 - Rolling release.
 - Uses the latest stable Linux kernel, development snapshot from kernel.org
   can also be installed in parallel.
 - Kernel images/modules are never removed always providing bootable system.
 - Uses a modified "initramfs-tools" version from Debian to handle initial
   ramdisk images.
 - Uses a modified "casper" version from Ubuntu to boot from live images.
 - Uses a modified "OpenRC" version from Gentoo to handle the init/boot process.
 - Uses /run directory as tmpfs by default, with symlinks to /tmp, /var/tmp,
   /var/lock, /var/run, /dev/shm.
 - It's not a fork or customized version of any distro, it has been created
   from scratch and making it a lightweight alternative. Base system takes
   150MB approximately.
 - Uses its own binary package system: XBPS. A fast alternative to Debian's
   dpkg/apt, RedHat's RPM, ArchLinux' pacman, etc.
 - Uses a BSD port-like system to build binary packages in chroot jails,
   without requiring root permissions. Use your ordinary user and will not mess
   with your real system!
 - You don't need wrappers to wrappers to the XBPS utils to rebuild/reinstall
   packages. The provided tools is all what you need.

When a new XBPS stable version comes out, a new live image is created for
testing purposes with the minimal base system, you can find them at:
