Welcome to the official Vanilla GNU/Linux git repository.
=================================================================

Vanilla GNU/Linux is a new distribution that uses XBPS as its package system,
The X Binary Package System has been designed from scratch, please visit
http://code.google.com/p/xbps for more information.

Vanilla GNU/Linux is a simple and minimal distribution that can be customized
in many ways. Currently there are ~1500 packages in the stable repository that you can
build. There is support for i686 and x86_64 architectures, more
may be added in a future (i.e. ARM) but it's not a high priority.

Some features:
 - It's not a fork or customized version of any distro, it has been created
   from scratch making it an extremely lightweight distro. Base install is
   approximately 150MB.
 - Rolling release.
 - Uses the latest stable Linux kernel. The development snapshot from kernel.org
   can also be installed in parallel.
 - Kernel images/modules are never removed, providing an always-bootable system.
 - Uses a modified "initramfs-tools" version from Debian to handle initial
   ramdisk images.
 - Uses a modified "casper" version from Ubuntu to boot from live images.
 - Uses a modified "OpenRC" version from Gentoo to handle the init/boot process.
 - Uses /run directory as tmpfs by default, with symlinks to /tmp, /var/tmp,
   /var/lock, /var/run, /dev/shm.
 - Uses its own binary package system: XBPS -- A faster/leaner alternative to Debian's
   dpkg/apt, RedHat's RPM, ArchLinux's Pacman, etc.
 - You don't need wrappers of wrappers for the XBPS utils to rebuild/reinstall
   packages. The provided tools are all that you need.
 - Uses a BSD port-like system to build binary packages in chroot jails
   without requiring root permissions. This allows building packages as a regular user
   without interfering with your installed system!

When a new stable XBPS version comes out, a new live image is created for
testing purposes along with the minimal base system.
